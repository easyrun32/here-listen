ü§ñ [Alexa-repo](https://github.com/easyrun32/here-listen-alexa) Alexa repo code on Aws Lambda

Here listen is a microservice app that uses Alexa. Well... soon to use Alexa. This is a boilerplate as of now but it's already deployable with codebuild using ecs.
<br/>
But this project is to deliver important notices to an online bussiness or ongoing projects.

## Example

<ins></ins>
Say you have a project or a team and you want them to be informed about what's going on? ü§î

With Here listen you simply say üó£Ô∏è

"Hey Alexa ... Open Here Listen"
<br/>

"Tell the bois we don't have work tomorrow"

"Tell the bois I hope you have added Continous integration! üò°"

### Features for the future

- Maybe we can add an Emoji to comments
  "Emojis are cool"
- Workflows are cool

### Technologies

Here listen uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - An awesome front end libary
- [Docker] üê≥ - To keep our application containerized from this updating Era
- [Aws] - A varity of services to make our web app fast and add crazyiness
- [Terraform] Cause aws is massive and setting it up is a hazzel. So we use this!
- [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework

# Want to contribute? Great!

It's ok don't be afraid to contribute to this project is in its early stages! Right now it's just suppose to login and logout. To get this up and running. Docker üê≥ will help you.

<li>Go to this project in Terminal or CMD</li>

</ol>

## (Unix Users)

```
export REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001
// You can check if this work by doing
env

// For first time users
npm run starting


// then start up your environment with
npm run build


// Also beware docker will eat your memory i have stuff to help you at the end of this Readme.md
```

## (Windows 10 pro Users)

You'll probably run into a FileSharing error because windows loves protecting you!
<br/>

```
Docker.Core.DockerException Filesharing has been cancelled
```

here is a link to fix this
<br/>
[file-share-error]
Bacially go to the Docker app ->dashboard ->click the setting wheel -> resources-> filesharing
then add your working directory

<br/>
then...

```
// For first time users
npm run starting

SET  REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001

// To check all your env type

SET

// then start up your environment with

npm run build

```

Thats it !üòÑ

## Note Docker will eat up your ssd or hdd

You can fix this in the resource and accumalate how much memory docker needs
personally i do 16gb

## Also to delete docker images

This site will help alot. Or you can clean docker by doing this just clears docker dangling volume

```
npm run clean

```

## TEST IT üîé üî¨

[localhost:3007](http://localhost:3007) For Client
<br/>

[localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) For User Server

This project will virtualize itself in a container and Install all the dependencies and devDependencies to start the application.

## Infrastructure setup

Fill in all terraform information in terraform.example.tfvars

and rename to terrafrom.tfvars

MAKE SURE YOU DONT PUT THAT INTO GITHUB

After you created codebuild with aws

with repository with my github

- enabled report build statuses

Under Primary source webhook events

- Rebuild every time a code change is pushed to this repository

^ important cause

ecs task definition will update the code otherwise nothing will happen

Then

- Create a role for codebuild with these policy names

* AmazonS3FullAccess
* AmazonECS_FullAccess
* AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryPowerUser

This is for codebuild to have permissions to well ecs.. and s3

For S3 the reason you need a policy name well its cause i stored my dockerhub personal token in s3

https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-new-personal-access-tokens/

so..

Look at my aws s3 for the path s3://docker-token/.docker.key and call it
.docker.key

`- aws s3 cp s3://docker-token/.docker.key .docker.key`

And login with the token

`docker login -u {your_username} --password-stdin < .docker.key `

remove it cause spies are watching...
`docker rm .docker.key`

Some terraform code is moduled meaning it's from a terraform libary.
Ecs_cluster is from a libary i used

Then do

```
cd /terraform

terraform init

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C {Your_email} -N '' -f ./{Name_of_file}

```

- You should get two files
- One that says {Name_of_files}.pub and the other one {Name_of_file}
- change the {Name_of_file} to {Name_of_file}.pem
- upload the .pem file to aws key pair to ssh into ec2 instance

```
terraform apply

```

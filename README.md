# Herelisten

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Herelisten uses alexa to make http request to the application.

## Example

<ins></ins>
Say you have a project or a team and you want them to be informed about what's going on? ü§î

With Herelisten you simply say üó£Ô∏è

"Hey Alexa ..."
<br/>
"Tell the bois we don't have work tomorrow"

### Features

Maybe we can add an Emoji to comments
Emojis are cool

### Tech

Herelisten uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - An awesome front end libary
- [Docker] üê≥ - To keep our application containerized from this updating Era
- [Aws] - A varity of services to make our web app fast and add crazyiness
- [Terraform] Cause aws is massive and setting it up is a hazzel. So we use this!
- [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework

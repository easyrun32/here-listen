[![<easyrun32>](https://circleci.com/gh/easyrun32/here-listen.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/easyrun32/here-listen?branch=main)

Here listen is a microservice app that uses Alexa. Well... soon to use Alexa. This is a boilerplate as of now but it's already deployable with codebuild using ecs.
<br/>
But this project is to deliver important notices to an online bussiness or ongoing projects.

## Example

<ins></ins>
Say you have a project or a team and you want them to be informed about what's going on? ü§î

With Here listen you simply say üó£Ô∏è

"Hey Alexa ... Open Here Listen"
<br/>

"Tell the bois we don't have work tomorrow"

"Tell the bois I hope you have added Continous integration! üò°"

### Features for the future

- Maybe we can add an Emoji to comments
  "Emojis are cool"
- Workflows are cool

### Technologies

Here listen uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React] - An awesome front end libary
- [Docker] üê≥ - To keep our application containerized from this updating Era
- [Aws] - A varity of services to make our web app fast and add crazyiness
- [Terraform] Cause aws is massive and setting it up is a hazzel. So we use this!
- [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework

<br/>

```

```

here is a link to fix this
<br/>
[file-share-error]
Bacially go to the Docker app ->dashboard ->click the setting wheel -> resources-> filesharing
then add your working directory

<br/>
then...

```
// For first time users
npm run starting

SET  REACT_APP_USERS_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001

// To check all your env type

SET

// then start up your environment with

npm run build

```

## Note Docker will eat up your ssd or hdd

You can fix this in the resource and accumalate how much memory docker needs
personally i do 16gb

## Also to delete docker images

This site will help alot. Or you can clean docker by doing this just clears docker dangling volume

```
npm run clean
```
